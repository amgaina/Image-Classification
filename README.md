# Multiclass Image Classification Model using CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for multiclass image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model distinguishes between 10 different classes of images, aiming to achieve an accuracy of approximately 70% on the test set.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Labels:
- 0: airplane
- 1: automobile
- 2: bird
- 3: cat
- 4: deer
- 5: dog
- 6: frog
- 7: horse
- 8: ship
- 9: truck

## Tools and Libraries Used
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing images and training metrics.
- Scikit-learn: For evaluating model performance and preprocessing data.
